## Features:

## Limitations:
- Only can add 1 genre to a Book
- Partial search on Authors or Titles not implemented
- Title needs to added with title() function (makes first letter Uppercase)
- Must first register Author before adding them to a Book
- Cannot add multiple authors while editing
